Angular (CLI) Quiz App

To run the Angular project:

1. cd ng-app
2. npm install
3. ng serve

Then open http://localhost:4200

Note: This is a full Angular (TypeScript) project and requires Node.js and the Angular CLI. If you prefer the static variant (open index.html directly), use the top-level `index.html` and `src/app/*` JS files (AngularJS) in the repo root.
