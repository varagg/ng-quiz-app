Angular-style Quiz App (Static)

This is a small quiz application implemented with AngularJS for easy static hosting (open index.html directly).

How to run

- Open `index.html` in your browser (no server needed). For best results, use a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari).

Project structure

- index.html — main entry
- styles.css — global styles
- src/app/ — app scripts and components
- src/assets/questions.json — quiz data

Notes

This uses AngularJS (1.x) so it runs without a build step. The structure mimics Angular concepts (modules, components, services) to satisfy the assignment requirements while remaining static-run friendly.
